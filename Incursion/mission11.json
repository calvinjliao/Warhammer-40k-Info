                  &#xA;At the end of each players turn, the player whose turn it is scores 2VP if they satisfy one of the following conditions, or 3VP if they satisfy both of the following conditions:
                  &#xA;They control every objective marker on the battlefield or they control at least one objective marker they did not control at the start of their turn.
                  &#xA;They destroyed at least one enemy unit that was within range of an objective marker at the start of their turn.
                  &#xA;&#xA;
                  In this mission, if a player controls an objective marker at the end of their Command phase and one or more of their units that are within range of it has the Objective Secured ability, it remains under that playerâ€™s control unless their opponent controls it at the end of any subsequent phase, even if there are no models within range of it."

      "description": "If you select this objective, RAVEN GUARD units from your army can attempt the following action:

                      Plant Explosives (Action): One or more RAVEN GUARD CORE INFANTRY units from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase. Each unit from your army that starts to perform this action must be within range of a different objective marker you control that does not have explosives planted on it by your army. The action is completed at the end of your turn. If completed, that objective marker is said to have explosives planted on it by your army.
                      At the end of any playerâ€™s turn, for each objective marker that has explosives planted on it by your army, if that objective marker is controlled by your opponent, you can perform a controlled explosion with it. If you do so, that objective marker is no longer said to have explosives planted on it by your army, and for each unit within range of that objective marker roll one D6: on a 2+, that unit suffers 3 mortal wounds. You cannot perform a controlled explosion with an objective marker in the same turn it had explosives planted on it by your army.

                      At the end of the battle, score 3 VP for each objective marker that still has explosives planted on it by your army."

                      Weave Veil (Psychic Action - Warp Charge 4): One SHADOWSEER model from your army can attempt to perform this psychic action in your Psychic phase if it is within 18\" of an enemy unit that has not yet been veiled by your army (see below). If this psychic action is completed, select one enemy unit that has not yet been veiled by your army and is within 18\" of the SHADOWSEER model that completed this psychic action. That enemy unit is said to have been veiled by your army, and the warp charge value of this psychic action is increased by 1 for your army for the remainder of the battle.

These objective markers cannot be set up within 9\" of each other, within 6\" of a battlefield edge or within 3\" of another objective marker.

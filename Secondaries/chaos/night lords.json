•An enemy unit fails a Morale test.
•An enemy unit Falls Back.
•An enemy unit fails an action.

In addition, each time an enemy unit is destroyed by a melee attack made by a NIGHT LORDS model from your army, before removing the last model in that enemy unit from the battlefield, roll 2 D6: if the result equals or exceeds the Leadership characteristic of that enemy model, score 1 VP.
A model can, if it is resurrected for any reason, potentially contribute victory points due to this secondary objective several times."

      "description": "If you select this objective, BLACK LEGION INFANTRY and BLACK LEGION BIKER units from your army can attempt the following action:

Despoil Dominions (Action): One BLACK LEGION INFANTRY or BLACK LEGION BIKER unit from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase if it is within range of an objective marker that you control that has not already been despoiled by your army. If the unit performing this action has the Troops Battlefield Role, the action is completed at the end of your turn; otherwise, the action is completed at the start of your next Command phase or at the end of the battle (whichever comes first). In any case, it is only completed if the unit performing it is still within range of the same objective marker. If completed, that objective marker is said to have been despoiled by your army, and until the end of the battle, each time an enemy unit starts to perform an action while it is within range of that despoiled objective marker, roll one D6: on a 4+, that action immediately fails.

Each time a unit from your army completes this action, if the objective marker that was despoiled by that action was wholly within your deployment zone, score 1 VP; otherwise, score 4 VP."

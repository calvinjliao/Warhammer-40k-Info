      "description": "If you select this objective, ALPHA LEGION INFANTRY units from your army can attempt the following action:

                      Subvert (Action): One ALPHA LEGION INFANTRY unit (excluding CHARACTER units) from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase if it is wholly within 6\" of your opponent’s deployment zone. The action is completed at the end of your turn, provided the unit performing it is still wholly within 6\" of your opponents deployment zone. If completed, if the unit that performed the action is within range of an objective marker, roll one D6 to see if that objective marker has been subverted. If that unit was a CULTISTS unit, on a 5+ that objective marker is said to have been subverted by your army; otherwise, on a 4+ that objective marker is said to have been subverted by your army. Enemy units can never control objective markers that have been subverted by your army, and can never perform actions while they are within range of any objective markers that have been subverted by your army.

                      Each time a unit from your army completes this action, score 3 VP. Score 4 VP instead if that unit completed this action while wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone."

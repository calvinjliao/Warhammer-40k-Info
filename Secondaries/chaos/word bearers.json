      "description": "If you select this objective, keep an Exalt the Dark Gods tally; add 1 to that tally each time a WORD BEARERS unit from your army completes the following action:

Exalt the Dark Gods (Action): One WORD BEARERS INFANTRY unit from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase if it is wholly within 6\" of the centre of the battlefield. WORD BEARERS PSYKER units can attempt to manifest psychic powers while performing this action without this action failing. If the unit performing this action is a WORD BEARERS ICON, WORD BEARERS DARK APOSTLE or WORD BEARERS MASTER OF POSSESSION unit, this action is completed at the end of your turn; otherwise, it is completed at the start of your next Command phase. In any case, the action is only completed if the unit performing it is still wholly within 6\" of the centre of the battlefield and no enemy units (excluding AIRCRAFT units) are wholly within 6\" of the centre of the battlefield.

At the end of the battle, score 3 VP if your Exalt the Dark Gods tally is 1; score 5 VP if that tally is 2; score 9 VP if that tally is 3; score 15 VP if that tally is 4 or more."
